how long to crank
how long to crank if it doesnt
check start parameter

setting up load test for engine cell widget
dyno mode - motor or absorb (negative torque means motoring)
then say what mode dyno is in rpm or load (newton meters) control 
then give it setpoint accordingly 

then upload csv file - testtime in seconds, setpoint for pids, dyno mode, 
calculate setpoint diff based ont time of next entry

PIDS
Dyno1
Dyno2
Throttle
Oil
Intercooler
Coolant
Misc1
Misc2
Misc3
Misc4

We only need Setpoints - Live tuning from the other config

Formula for PIDS is Velocity 

Save phase setting, test settings
dialog to retrieve old phases and import into test
in the new phase area add save phase with description, and the button to open the dialog for an old phase

on the main window we need to add stuff to create or use an older test setup to run. 
i think the default should be blank with a callout to create or add a new test

add setting for phase on where to go after completion and if an error occurs. 
there's a chance we might need to have an option for each error from each widget does something different.

Phase Area -> Phase Name | Update Phase -> Save Phase -> Delete Phase -> Completion Options (Move to next phase, cancel test, jump to another phase, etc.)

if dyno is electrict needs both dyno mode and condition (absorb motor both)
DynoPidMode is speed control
DynoMode motor only goes up, absorb allows down ,ie 1000 rpm motor is at 900 so motor 100rpm but if its 1500rpm and not on absorb dyno does nothing

Motor mode => dyno motor not engine
 
DynoMode => Motor = M, Absorb = A, Both = B
MotorMode => Speed = S, Load = L, Direct = D

Line in CSV "Mode,NULL,MotorMode,MotorMode by channel config

Add error messaging when reading in csv if no mode set initially, also maybe if time doesn't start at zero
