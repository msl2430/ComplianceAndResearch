Release Notes for OptoMMP2.DLL

Release 1.0.8.4 (2014-10-27)
	-	[NOTE] Assembly version 1.0 has entered maintenance only, to fix issues
		encountered. Please build application updates with the newest version
		of this SDK available.

	-	[FIX] ReadSerialModuleConfiguration parameters i32Eom and b4WireMode
		now correctly report.
		
	-	[FIX] WriteSerialModuleConfiguration correctly applies all
		parameters.
		
	-	[FIX] Corrected thread locking procedures. Multithreaded apps should
		now see speedy (faster) operation.
	
	-	[FIX] All TCP/IP sockets enforce disabling of Nagle's Algorithm. This
		is TCP socket property "System.Net.Sockets.NoDelay = true."

	-	[FIX] An unsuccessful Open() using UDP will result in an unhandled
		exception with GetExtendedErrorInformation(). This is corrected.
		

Release 1.0.8.3 (2013-04-22)
	-   [NEW] When using PIDs (VELOCITY-C algorithm) on R8.5e firmware and with
		the input set to receive values from the supervisory system, you must
		use a new enumeration to set this value or you'll find the PID
		very hard to tune due to the P term effectively set to zero.
		
	-	[NEW] Several method overloads were added where prior, only bitmasks
		were used.
		These overloads provide a Boolean Array overload.
		
		ReadDigitalStates64()
		ReadDigitalLatches64()
		ReadClearDigitalLatches64()
		
	-	[NEW] The Intellisense file is now included.
	
	-	[NEW] Support for I/O Unit Scratchpad Bits.
	
		ScratchpadBitsRead()
		ScratchpadBitsRead()
		ScratchpadBitRead()
		ScratchpadBitsWrite()
		ScratchpadBitsWrite()
		ScratchpadBitWrite()
		
	-	[NEW] Discrete Output Pulse-Period Methods. #82707
		
		AboutPulses() (informational method only, see Intellisense/XML comments)
		ConfigureContinuousPulsesTime()
		ConfigureContinuousPulsesDuration()
		ConfigureNPulsesTime()
		ConfigureNPulsesDuration()
		StartPulse()
		StopPulse()
		WritePulsePercentage()
		ReadPulsePercentage()
		WritePulsePeriod()
		ReadPulsePeriod()
		WritePulseOnOffTime()
		ReadPulseOnOffTime()
			
	-	[FIX] The timeout supplied on the .Open() method wasn't being used
		within the context of the library.

	-	[FIX] Nagel's algorithm disabled for TCP/IP. This may have caused occasional
		pauses in messaging I/O units when using the TCP/IP protocol. This required
		high frequencies of small packets to induce this issue. #82507
	
	-	[FIX] In ReadAnalogStates64(), if the data array was longer than 64 elements,
		a -1 would be returned.
		
	-	[Note] An update to the documentation generator application has made the embedded code
		examples difficult to read. The code examples within the Intellisense have been removed.
	
Release 1.0.6.0 (2011-10-24) 
	-	Some changes for IPv6 connections (won't affect any apps).
	-	Added more comments/documentation to describe the use of the library.
	-	A fix was made to method ScratchpadStringRead. It worked in 8.5 and 
		earlier firmware but a change to the 9.x firmware caused this method to fail.
	-	Added methods PidRead() and PidWrite(). This does _not_ support PID
		modules (a legacy product for the SNAP family).
	-	Method WriteScannerFlags() could throw an exception due to a mutex issue.
		This is fixed. The network communication must had faulted prior to the entry
		of this method for the throw to occur.
	-	If using UDP and an error is thrown internally by the UDP socket, Open would
		return successful (even though it failed). This is corrrected.

Release 1.0.3.0 (2011-03-07)
	-	Added IPv6 enumerations for connection options.
	-	Changed which PC platforms are supported (dropped XP due to some TCP/IP issues).

Release 1.0.2.1 (2011-02-23)
	-	Updated the documentation, no changes to the code or DLL made. DLL didn't change versions.

Release 1.0.2.0 (2010-08-25)
	-	Initial Release
