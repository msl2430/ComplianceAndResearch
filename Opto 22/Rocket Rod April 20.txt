Change alarm inactive button to say trigger
save entire trigger settings in the database for use later - like venue section plan configuration

bigger alarm menu
alarm triggers
- alarm
- outliers - out for certain amount of time
- events - something you meant to happen. like change stages

change alarm window to triggers
custom list of triggers associated with point
set value, choose whether alarm or event, choose time must stay at set value, choose action if event (ie change stage)

PID - Parallel
Gain = TuneP (whatever that shit means)

copy pid config screen from PAC. create new chart in pac to read settings from scratchpad. using the existing pid loops plus 4 custom pids for now
have to add SQL to store the settings so that each time we start up the app it resets the pids

lower upper clamp change per stage? see if we can do this from the OptoScript
