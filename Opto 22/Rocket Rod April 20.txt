Change alarm inactive button to say trigger
save entire trigger settings in the database for use later - like venue section plan configuration

bigger alarm menu
alarm triggers
- alarm
- outliers - out for certain amount of time
- events - something you meant to happen. like change stages

change alarm window to triggers
custom list of triggers associated with point
set value, choose whether alarm or event, choose time must stay at set value, choose action if event (ie change stage)

PID - Parallel
Gain = TuneP (whatever that shit means)

copy pid config screen from PAC. create new chart in pac to read settings from scratchpad. using the existing pid loops plus 4 custom pids for now
have to add SQL to store the settings so that each time we start up the app it resets the pids

lower upper clamp change per stage? see if we can do this from the OptoScript

RPM NM AND % are all different P,I,D in that need to be stored in DB and set each time we start the app. The PID Display on the main screen
is the setpoint and can be adjusted when in manual mode

Bug on setpoint when trying to change it updates itself. 

change alarm screen on point config to settings, record, average, stripchart, scale

ventilation calculation - paul needs setpoint to conigured then thats it. let pac control do the calc
Inner Temp - Setpoint / Innertemp-outertemp x Gain = ventilation variable
Add config where you can pick two thermal couple points, an analog outpt, set gain, and set a setpoint - read data in do calc and send to analog output

output config screen: ask for analog input to control set on value set off value

create save directory for csv report
